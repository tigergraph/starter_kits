CREATE QUERY multi_transaction (VERTEX<Transaction> transaction) FOR GRAPH AntiFraud SYNTAX v2 {
 /*
   This query is motivated by detecting money laundering activities between two groups. Given 
   a transaction, it finds the network of users related to the sender, and finds the network 
   of users related to the receiver. Then, it finds all transactions among the two networks.

   Intuitively, this query can help data analysts to visualize the money laundering activities, 
   since it can visualize the transactions between the sender and receiver groups, and the 
   transaction patterns within each network.

    1) Start from an input transaction, find its sender and receiver
    2) Start from the sender, via Device_Token and Payment_Instrument edges find users within 4 steps. 
    3) Start from the receiver, via Device_Token and Payment_Instrument edges find users within 4 steps.
    4) Record transactions cross the sender and receiver groups.

    Sample input:
    transaction: any integer between 1 and 500.
